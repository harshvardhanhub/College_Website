        <h2>6G WIRELESS COMMUNICATION – SECURITY CHALLENGES TRUST AND AUTHENTICATION</h2>
        <p class="meta">February 27, 2023 | No Comments | Engineering & Sciences</p>
        <img src="Collegepic/blog1.jpg" alt="Blog Post 1">
        <p>As 5G communication networks are being deployed for industrial and commercial applications, 6G communication also has drawn the attention of the end users. This is due to the increase in data-centric intelligent applications, which also challenged the capacity and features of 5G. For example, the existing delay in internet-based telemedicine applications is about 1msec, whereas the requirement is less than 0.1msec., which is not satisfied by the ultra-high bandwidth and low-latency features of 5G communication. This limitation of 5G cannot gratify the high communication and low latency requirements of data-centric industrial and healthcare services. As a result, Universities and Industries have started developing 6G technology with the requirements of higher bandwidth and reliability, better QoS and coverage, low-latency and power consumption, better privacy, and security. The key performance indicators of 6G communication are specified in Table(1). 6G is a revolutionary generation of wireless communication with the added dimensions of intelligence and autonomy to bring new vigor and vitality into next-generation communication because it can sense the situation and adoptively fix the bandwidth.</p>

        <p>Most BTech students have yet to learn what should be pursued after completing their degree. Even though the job market for core engineering fields in India seems saturated, the necessity of reviving the number of skilled professionals and investing in core engineering fields has indeed been recognized by the technological society in recent times. New technological advancements in power, electronics, robotics, aerospace, biomedical instrumentation, and many more are truly remarkable and have opened a new world of possibilities for core engineering graduates. If one still feels that they lack opportunities, it may be attributed to the lack of awareness of the plethora of options awaiting one after graduation..</p>
